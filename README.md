We aimed to recreate the classic game “Pong”. This version of the game is played by a single player, who
moved the paddle on the screen up/down and has to bounce the ball off of it, without letting it get past and
colliding with the wall behind it.
A player would start with 3 balls. Every time the ball hits the left edge of the screen, a ball is lost, and the
ball respawns in the center of the screen, and score remains unchanged.
The speed of the ball increases as the score increases to increase the difficulty of the game.
Once the player runs out of balls, the score resets 0 and the text “Game Over” is displayed.
The game is programmed using Verilog HDL and a keyboard is used to move the paddle up/down.
